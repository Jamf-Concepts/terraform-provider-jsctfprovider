# jsc_admin (Resource)

Manages a JSC admin account. Used in the SwiftConnect Mini Onboarder to provision a helpdesk-style operator account that can view device reports and clear security issues that may block enrollment, without the ability to modify policy.

## Notes

- Update is implemented as delete + recreate (PUT endpoint inferred but not confirmed via API traffic capture)
- A 404 on read causes Terraform to mark the resource as destroyed and recreate on next `apply`
- Known roles: `WRITE_ADMIN`, `SUPER_ADMIN`, `GLOBAL_ADMIN`, `MAGIC`
- `SUPER_ADMIN` stacks on top of `WRITE_ADMIN` — a super admin has both roles
- For a helpdesk-style account: use `WRITE_ADMIN` with limited permissions (`DEVICES`, `ACCESS`)

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "jsc_admin" "swiftconnect_helpdesk" {
  name     = "SwiftConnect Helpdesk"
  username = "sc-helpdesk@customer.com"

  roles       = ["WRITE_ADMIN"]
  permissions = ["DEVICES", "ACCESS"]
}
```
