# jsc_admin (Resource)

Manages a JSC admin account with configurable roles and permissions.

## Notes

- **Roles**: Empty array (`[]`) or omitted = read-only admin. Known elevated roles: `SUPER_ADMIN`, `GLOBAL_ADMIN`, `MAGIC`
- **Permissions**: Optional if role is `SUPER_ADMIN` (permissions are auto-granted by JSC). Required for read-only admins.
- Update is implemented as delete + recreate (PUT endpoint not confirmed)
- A 404 on read causes Terraform to mark the resource as destroyed and recreate on next `apply`

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Read-only admin with specific permissions
resource "jsc_admin" "readonly_helpdesk" {
  name     = "Helpdesk Read-Only"
  username = "helpdesk-ro@customer.com"

  # Empty roles = read-only
  roles       = []
  permissions = ["DEVICES", "ACCESS", "AUDIT_LOGS"]
}

# Super admin (permissions auto-granted)
resource "jsc_admin" "super_admin" {
  name     = "Super Administrator"
  username = "admin@customer.com"

  roles = ["SUPER_ADMIN"]
  # Permissions not needed - auto-granted by SUPER_ADMIN role
}
```
