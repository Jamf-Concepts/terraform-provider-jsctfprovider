# jsc_swiftconnect (Resource)

Configures a SwiftConnect physical access credential issuance integration for a JSC tenant. This is a singleton resource — only one integration is supported per tenant.

When a SwiftConnect integration is active, the JSC tenant can issue physical access credentials (e.g. mobile wallet passes) to devices that meet the configured risk level threshold.

## Notes

- Singleton resource: only one SwiftConnect integration is allowed per JSC tenant.
- The integration `id` returned by the API is stored as the Terraform resource ID and is required for deletion.
- The API uses a `v1` endpoint for create/read and a `v2` endpoint for delete. This asymmetry is handled internally by the resource.
- A 404 response on read causes Terraform to mark the resource as destroyed and recreate it on next `apply`.
- Update is implemented as delete + recreate (no `PUT` endpoint confirmed).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "jsc_swiftconnect" "swiftconnect_integration" {
  base_url       = "https://api.swiftconnect.io"
  application_id = "your-swiftconnect-application-id"
  origo_uuid     = "your-origo-uuid"

  # Optional
  organization_uuid    = "your-organization-uuid"
  risk_level_enabled   = true
  risk_level_threshold = "HIGH"
}
```
