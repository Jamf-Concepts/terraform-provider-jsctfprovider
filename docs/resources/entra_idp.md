# jsc_entra_idp (Resource)

Manages an Entra (Azure AD) identity provider connection in JSC. Used to configure end-user authentication via Azure AD for ZTNA app access.

## OAuth Consent Requirement

Entra IdP connections require a manual consent step that cannot be automated. During `terraform apply`, the resource:

1. Creates the Entra connection in JSC
2. Triggers a consent transaction to generate a Microsoft OAuth URL
3. Stores the URL as a **sensitive computed attribute** (`consent_url`) — retrieve it with `terraform output consent_url`
4. Visit the URL in a browser to grant consent
5. After completing consent, run `terraform refresh` to update the `state` attribute to `APPROVED`

The `consent_url` attribute is marked `sensitive = true` — it will not appear in plan or apply output but is stored in Terraform state.

## Notes

- Update is implemented as delete + recreate — a new consent URL will be generated
- If the connection is deleted outside Terraform, the next `terraform plan` will detect drift and offer to recreate it
- Connection states: `INITIAL` → `PENDING` → `APPROVING` → `APPROVED` | `DENIED`

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "jsc_entra_idp" "entra_connection" {
  name = "Entra IdP"
}

output "entra_idp_state" {
  value = jsc_entra_idp.entra_connection.state
}

output "entra_consent_url" {
  value     = jsc_entra_idp.entra_connection.consent_url
  sensitive = true
}
```
